Project Summary: Avocado Data Analysis
Objective:
The goal of this project was to analyze the avocado dataset to uncover valuable insights that could help improve product strategies and boost sales.

Methodology:

Data Collection:

The dataset was obtained from the Kaggle Avocado Prices dataset.
Data Preprocessing:

Checked and handled missing values.
Identified and removed duplicate rows.
Converted the date column to a datetime format.
Data Integration:

Utilized Hadoop MapReduce to perform data integration tasks.
Implemented mapper and reducer scripts to aggregate total volume by region.
Utilized Apache Spark for data transformations and advanced analytics tasks.
Evaluation and Analysis:

Evaluated the quality of the dataset by checking for missing values and duplicates.
Generated summary statistics to understand the distribution of various columns.
Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the data.
Visualization:

Created visualizations to present meaningful and actionable insights:
Distribution of Average Prices: A histogram showing the distribution of average prices.
Total Volume Over Time: A line plot illustrating the trend of total volume over time.
Total Volume by Region: A bar plot comparing the total volume across different regions.
Findings and Insights:

The average price of avocados mostly ranged between $1 and $2.
Significant seasonal trends were observed in avocado sales volumes.
Regions such as California and the West had higher total volumes, indicating greater demand.
Conclusion:
The project provided valuable insights into the pricing and sales trends of avocados across different regions in the US. The analysis highlighted key trends and differences in avocado sales, which could inform future strategies for marketing and distribution.

Future Work:
Future work could involve more detailed time-series analysis and exploring the impact of external factors such as weather conditions and market trends on avocado prices and sales volumes.
